# How to run the program
`CM.make "project.cm"`
`Fibonacci.fibonacci ()`

# Result
Output gives the file name of the program, the ranking function, and the invariants for fibonacci. We call synthesis in synthesis.sml to run the actual synthesis algorithm. Many of the functions give the exact solution without computing them, since we do not have the resources or technologies to do them ourselves.
